• This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Deep Learning Web App___ created with ___Streamlit___ on ___Heroku___ platform.

• For this project I have used CIFAR-10 dataset from Kaggle. The WebApp is created to predict and categories different images in thier respective categories. This model is developed using Convolution Neural Network.

• Folder link for __Code__, __Algorithms used__ and __Accuracy__ of the model.. Click the link mentioned below for the same:<br />

• Link for WebApp, you can visit : [image-classifier-model](https://image-classifier-model.herokuapp.com/)

• A glimpse of the web app:

#### 1 . GUI interface 
This is an interface of model where we need to upload any picture.

#### 2 . Making First Prediction
Here I have uploaded a image of Horse and we can see how accurate model is predicting.

#### 3 . Making another Prediction
Next I tried with another image which was Truck's image, and here also it predicted its respective category so accurately.
